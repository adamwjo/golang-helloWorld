<h1> Hello Golang!!</h1>

<p>This small app is for the purposes of my own learning as well as a refrence for other beginners</p>

<h3>How is the code run?</h3>

<p>
    - First make sure you are in your projects directory
    and that you have Go installed.
    - The command for running a Go file is "go run <filename>"
    - In my case it's go run main.go
</P>


<h3>What does 'package main' mean?</h3>
- A packackage in Golang is basically the project or workspace
- There are two different types of packages, an executeable and a reusable.
- An executable file is a file that returns, once compiled, a file that can be run by the computer.
- Reusable packages are more like code dependencies or libraries
- the "main" naming convention is used only when defining an executable file in Golang.
    

<h3>How is a function defined?</h3>

<h3>How is the main.go file organized?</h3>
